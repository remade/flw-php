## Flutterwave PHP: Consume APIs easily

This is a PHP library for Flutterwave's API with a straightforward usage. This
was created to solve an itch that comes with doing repetitive integration code


## Installation

FlutterwavePHP uses [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to install and update:

```
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar require remade/flw-php
```

The examples below use PHP 5.4 syntax, but Valitron works on PHP 5.3+. This is also 
platform agnostic

## Usage
